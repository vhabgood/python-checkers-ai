Of course. Pausing to document the architecture is an excellent idea. It helps clarify the program's structure and identify which components are stable.

Here is the program's class and method breakdown in a text file format, with comments indicating the methods we have tested and confirmed are working correctly.

  |
  |-- METHOD: draw(self, screen)
  |   |  INPUTS: screen (pygame.Surface)

  |
  |-- METHOD: is_clicked(self, pos)
  |   |  INPUTS: pos (tuple)

  |-- METHOD: select_player(self, color)
  |   |  INPUTS: color (tuple: RED or WHITE)
  |   |  OUTPUTS: None
  |   |  PURPOSE: Sets the player's chosen color and signals the game to transition to the loading state. # Tested and confirmed working.

CLASS: LoadingScreen
  |
  |-- METHOD: update(self)
  |   |  INPUTS: None
  |   |  OUTPUTS: None
  |   |  PURPOSE: Checks a queue for status messages from the loading thread and signals when loading is complete. # Tested and confirmed working.

======================================================================
FILE: engine/checkers_game.py
======================================================================

CLASS: CheckersGame
  |
  |-- METHOD: __init__(self, screen, player_color_str, status_queue, args)
  |   |  PURPOSE: Initializes the entire game, including the board, AI, and UI elements.
  |
  |-- METHOD: start_ai_turn(self, force_color=None)
  |   |  INPUTS: force_color (optional color tuple)
  |   |  OUTPUTS: None
  |   |  PURPOSE: Starts the AI's thinking process in a separate thread. Clears the previous analysis from the dev panel. # Tested and confirmed working.
  |
  |-- METHOD: run_ai_calculation(self, color_to_move)
  |   |  INPUTS: color_to_move (color tuple)
  |   |  OUTPUTS: None
  |   |  PURPOSE: The main function for the AI thread. Calls the search algorithm and puts the best move on the queue. # Tested and confirmed working.
  |
  |-- METHOD: _change_turn(self)
  |   |  INPUTS: None
  |   |  OUTPUTS: None
  |   |  PURPOSE: Flips the current turn from one player to the other and updates the game state accordingly. # Tested and confirmed working.
  |
  |-- METHOD: _apply_move_sequence(self, path)
  |   |  INPUTS: path (list of coordinate tuples)
  |   |  OUTPUTS: None
  |   |  PURPOSE: Applies a move or a sequence of jumps to the main game board. # Tested and confirmed working.
  |
  |-- METHOD: update(self)
  |   |  INPUTS: None
  |   |  OUTPUTS: None
  |   |  PURPOSE: The main game logic loop. Starts the AI when it's its turn and retrieves/applies the AI's chosen move from the queue. # Tested and confirmed working.
  |
  |-- METHOD: draw_dev_panel(self)
  |   |  INPUTS: None
  |   |  OUTPUTS: None
  |   |  PURPOSE: Draws the developer panel, displaying the AI's analysis from its most recent turn. # Tested and confirmed working.

======================================================================
FILE: engine/board.py
======================================================================

CLASS: Board
  |
  |-- METHOD: move(self, piece, row, col)
  |   |  INPUTS: piece (Piece object), row (int), col (int)
  |   |  OUTPUTS: None
  |   |  PURPOSE: Moves a piece on the board's internal representation and handles king promotion. # Tested and confirmed working.
  |
  |-- METHOD: get_all_valid_moves(self, color)
  |   |  INPUTS: color (tuple)
  |   |  OUTPUTS: dictionary of valid moves
  |   |  PURPOSE: The authoritative function for getting all legal moves for a player, correctly enforcing the mandatory jump rule. # Tested and confirmed working.
  |
  |-- METHOD: apply_move(self, path)
  |   |  INPUTS: path (list of coordinate tuples)
  |   |  OUTPUTS: new Board object
  |   |  PURPOSE: The AI's "imagination". Creates a copy of the board, applies a move, and returns the resulting board state for analysis. # Tested and confirmed working.

======================================================================
FILE: engine/search.py
======================================================================

FUNCTION: get_ai_move_analysis(board, depth, color_to_move, evaluate_func)
  |  INPUTS: board (Board object), depth (int), color_to_move (tuple), evaluate_func (function)
  |  OUTPUTS: best_move_path (list), top_5_for_display (list)
  |  PURPOSE: The top-level AI function that initiates the search and returns the best move and analysis. # Tested and confirmed working.

FUNCTION: minimax(board, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player, evaluate_func)
  |  INPUTS: board (Board object), depth (int), alpha (float), beta (float), maximizing_player (boolean), evaluate_func (function)
  |  OUTPUTS: score (float), best_path (list)
  |  PURPOSE: The core recursive search algorithm that explores the game tree to find the best move. # The source of the "double move" bug.

======================================================================
FILE: engine/evaluation.py
======================================================================

FUNCTION: evaluate_board(board)
  |  INPUTS: board (Board object)
  |  OUTPUTS: score (float)
  |  PURPOSE: The AI's "brain". Analyzes a board position and returns a score representing how good the position is for White. # Tested and confirmed working.

======================================================================
FILE: engine/piece.py
======================================================================

CLASS: Piece
  |  PURPOSE: Represents a single checker piece. All methods are simple setters/getters and are considered stable. # Tested and confirmed working.

======================================================================
FILE: engine/constants.py
======================================================================
  |  PURPOSE: Contains global constants for the game. No classes or methods. # Tested and confirmed working.
