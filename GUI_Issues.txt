2. Move History is no longer showing up. (Solved, however this one still may need to be made scrollable)
3. Undo button is gone. (Solved)
4. Reset button is gone. (Solved)
5. Force AI move button is gone. (Soved)
6. Export to PDN button gone. (Progress: if this does work, you would never know. it needs to say creating PDN and then file created "location/lsdf.txt")
8. In Dev mode, the AI has already made its move and then it takes a few seconds before the information displays on the screen. Ideally, we want to be able to see that info as the AI is evaluating things in real-time. (Progress: Great info on the screen, not sure if we can make it display as the AI is thinking or not. We can come back to this.)
